**Task 1.6. Development of a data management and analysis framework for linking and comparing omics datasets across diseases (J.M. Hancock, T. Režen).** Objectives: To develop and implement a data management (DM) framework that enables cross-disease comparison of different disease models. This should not only enable consistent, state-of-the art data analysis and integration across different experiments and disease models but also ensure compliance with the FAIR principles  (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) both within the programme and by sharing data via public repositories. Work plan: For optimal reuasability and FAIRness data should be collected in conformance with the standards needed for data reuse and sharing. Making use of the ELIXIR data management toolkit (RDMKit) , which provides guidance and tools for FAIR data management, we will develop a DM plan that describes how data should be collected and saved so that it can be readily found and reused within the Programme and formatted so that it can easily be submitted to the appropriate international data repositories. This should also ensure that data are collected in formats and with associated metadata that allow later reanalysis. We will also develop a list of the most useful computational tools for data analysis and collect SOPs for data analysis to assist in producing reproducible results (the DM&A Cookbook). Deliverables: 1.6.1, A data management plan for the typical data collection activities (M12 and bimonthly updates) 1.6.2. An updateable list of preferred analysis methods to reuse the collected data (M24)  1.6.3. A collection of SOPs for data analysis using the tools and data types listed (M36) 1.6.4. Published examples of analyses carried out using the Programme DM&A Cookbook (M60).
